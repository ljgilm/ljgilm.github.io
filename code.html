                                <hr>Created a mobile app in Mobile Application Development course. The app focuses on creating a space where users can post and easily keep track of lost and found dogs. Proposed the idea after seeing the aftermath of Hurricane Ida. I also was inspired by my dog Heidi who is a resuce from one of the many floods that occur in Louisiana. <br><br>I led the project and worked and coded with teammates to create an app. We were very proud of what we accomplished especially with the amount of time we lost because of Hurricane Ida. We did cut some features such as connecting the app to a database and having multiple users. However, we were able to prioritize the main features that we thought were important.

                                <hr>When deciding to purchase something online, there are so many options to choose from and keeping track of all them can be overwhelming. For me, I always end up having lots of tabs open to the point its unmanageable. Therefore, this program allows users to insert the different versions of a product they are interested in and then filter and sort them based on their preferences. An example could be wireless earbuds. However, this program is not limited to physical items. Other examples could also include different digital art programs, streaming services, etc. In fact, this could even be used to help people make decisions for things such as job opportunities.
                                <br><br>The goal of this program is to make it easier for people to organize all their options so that they can make the best decision.

                                <hr>Welcome to Shadows! You are a baby sea turtle that has just survived crossing the beach to reach the water. However, now you must survive in the sea from prey and pollution. Shadows is an endless runner. Don’t get hurt, and avoid the fishing nets! Collect sand dollars! Hide from the prey, a seagull, in the shadows of empty soda cans, or even in the enemy’s shadow itself! You can move the player using WASD or Arrow Keys. The goal of this game is to collect as many sand dollars as possible and stay alive! However, you must decide if leaving the shadows is worth the risk because the number of sand dollars you collect determines your score. The enemy will see you if you leave the shadows for too long and are too far from it, and it can come to attack you! You can always play again if you ldie and then try to beat your high score too! Enjoy! <br><br>Hint: If you leave the shadows for too long you could possibly lose 10 points of health. If you hit a net, you might lose 1 point of health.

                                <hr>Welcome to Carrot! You are a little rabbit trying to find the exit, a hole in the ground. Don’t get crushed by the boulders on your way, though! <br><br>

                                Carrot is an obstacle course and survival game where the world is constantly tilting. You must avoid getting hit by the boulders while you search for the exit. However, finding the exit and avoiding the boulders is not even the most challenging part. The exit, a hole in the ground, will run away from you if you get too close, so you need to chase after it. You can move the player using WASD or Arrow keys. The Left and right keys will rotate the player, while the top and bottom keys will move the player forward or backward. The game’s goal is to stay alive as long as you can and to find and catch the exit (technically speaking, run over the exit/ touch it). The other goal of this game is to learn and get the hang of how to maneuver in this world. The final experience with this game is that once the game ends, you have free range to just explore this little world. The idea of the exit was initially entering another hole, but I liked the idea of people still being able to see the world I built.
                                <br><br>
                                Depending on what version of the game you are playing, the difficulty changes. I made three different builds with different difficulties. I continued testing my game to determine the difficulty level of my game since there are many things to factor in, such as the exit’s speed, how much sliding affects the player, if sliding happens when the player is running or not, etc.
                                <br><br>
                                Hints: The exit is orange and is a flat circle, so you need to look out for it. Another hint is that the easiest way that I found to catch the exit is by already be running for a reasonable amount of time (depending on the difficulty level) so you can run over the exit to catch it.
